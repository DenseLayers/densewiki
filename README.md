# Introducing "DenseWiki"
### A repository of simple, plain-English explanations of popular concepts in Machine Learning and other disciplines.

To start, I've added explanations of a few concepts in Reinforcement Learning that keep coming up in popular papers:


[Actor Critic Methods](actor-critic.md)

  - [Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)](a2c.md)

    - [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](ppo.md)

    - [Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)](gae.md)



Feel free to contribute your own explanations (or suggest improvements to older ones)!
